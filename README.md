Module 2 VBA Challenge

This Excel VBA file takes several years of stock information and analyzes it.  The opening and closing values and total volume traded have been recorded for each day during several years for multiple stocks.  The VBA code then summarizes the information by creating a summary table including the ticker symbol, the yearly change in the closing and opening prices (in $), the percent change in the opening and closing prices, and the total volume of stock traded.  After this table is created, the code then finds the ticker symbol and the amount for the greatest percent increase in a year, the greatest percent decrease in a year, and the greatest total volume traded in a year and populates a new table with this information.

The file then runs through all years in the workbook automatically, populating the two tables for each year.
